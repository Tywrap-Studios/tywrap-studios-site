Hello all! We (mostly me, aka Tiazzz) lost access to our Contact Gmail account. Due to the way Google handles lost accounts, everything from this will be lost!  

All the messages you sent after quite a while ago we were and are not able to read, if you still need urgent help via e-mail, our business@tywrap-studios.tiazzz.me email works at all times at the moment and will always send an email to some active contact account. 
If any social media has `info.tywrap.studio@gmail.com` linked as the contact e-mail do NOT use it. In a few days the account will be automatically deleted due to inactivity from our side.

For casual questions though, you can always join our [Discord community](https://tiazzz.me/discord) and chat with us.

Have a good one, and sorry for the inconvenience!
