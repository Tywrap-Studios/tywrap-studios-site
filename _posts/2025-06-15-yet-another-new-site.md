Yeah, I've found yet another thing to make a site with, this time it's a Jekyll theme that is actually functional for once, and it also looks decent!
We all know how much I love Jekyll – I really don't, for the record – but this time it doesn't make it a hell to work with.

Now I won't say this theme was made for this organisation type of thing, because it was more or so for a personal portfolio,
but with enough tweaking, it can apparently be used for this too. And with tweaking I mean it's mostly me tweaking because again, I fucking hate Jekyll.

Anyway, I hope you like the new site, and if you don't, well, I don't care. It's my site, not yours. I frankly don't give a fuck. (but feedback is always welcome :D)
