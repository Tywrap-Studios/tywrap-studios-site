# **About Us**

Hi we are **{{ site.author.name }}**,
some people who like to make things in **Minecraft and other platforms.**  

We are very centred about creating **high quality content** for public use, and are always looking forward to making our software open source and available to everyone!

As such, we have a few projects that we are currently working on, and some that we have already released. You can look at them [here](/projects/).

Furthermore, please read our blogs! We sometimes write about our projects, and other things that we find interesting. You can find them [here](/blog/)!
